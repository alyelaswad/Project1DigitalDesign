### Instructions to use our application
Open the workflows folder, from there go to the Source Code directory, where you could find main.cpp file and run the file.
The application will ask you to input the pathname of each of the input files as well as the output file.

Make sure to include the right path to these files, or add them to the source code folder and just write their name.
Foe example: DD1.lib if the file is already in the source code folder, or /Users/alyalaswad/Desktop/DD1.lib if the file is somewhere on your system. 

You will see the output of the program in the output file you wrote to the terminal.

If you want to see a visual representation of the waveforms of the output, copy the sim file and paste it in the mysimulation.sim file in the QT Waveforms directory.

Build the project on QT.

Hope you like our work!
